# Project Initiation Document
# Professional Next.js Starter Template

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
To create a comprehensive, production-ready Next.js starter template that accelerates web application development by providing a solid foundation with integrated authentication, database connectivity, UI components, and developer tools.

### 1.2 Vision Statement
Develop the most developer-friendly, feature-rich Next.js starter kit that enables teams to launch robust web applications in a fraction of the time typically required, without compromising on code quality or scalability.

### 1.3 Key Objectives
- Create a template that follows industry best practices and current Next.js patterns
- Implement a modular, maintainable architecture that scales well
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- Include developer productivity tools and automated workflows
- Support both solo developers and teams with collaborative features

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Included Features
- **Next.js App Router** configuration with proper routing structure
- **MongoDB integration** with Mongoose models and connection handling
- **Authentication system** with NextAuth.js (multiple providers)
- **Material UI** integration with theming and responsive layouts
- **Admin dashboard** with data visualization components
- **Form handling** with react-hook-form and validation
- **API layer** with proper error handling and response formatting
- **Component library** with reusable UI elements
- **Dark/light mode** implementation with persistence
- **Code generation tools** for scaffolding components and pages
- **Storybook integration** for component documentation and development
- **Testing framework** setup with examples

### 2.2 Out of Scope
- Business logic specific to any particular domain
- Custom backend services beyond standard API routes
- Complex state management implementation (will provide hooks for integration)
- Deployment configurations for specific hosting providers
- Extensive content management features

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+, React 19+
- **Styling**: Material UI, Emotion
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Plop.js
- **Documentation**: Storybook, JSDoc
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

### 3.2 Architecture Overview
The template will follow a modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **App Layer**: Next.js App Router with layouts and pages
- **Component Layer**: Reusable UI components grouped by functionality
- **Data Access Layer**: API routes and database models
- **Authentication Layer**: NextAuth.js integration and middleware
- **Utilities Layer**: Helper functions and shared logic
