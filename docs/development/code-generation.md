# Code Generation

The MongoNext template includes a powerful code generation system that helps you quickly create new features, models, components, and API routes.

## Code Generation Tools
- Custom Node.js generator with EJS templates
- Interactive CLI with Commander.js and Inquirer.js
- Available generators for features, models, and components
- Customizable templates

## Feature Generation
The most common use case is generating a complete feature with all necessary files:

```bash
npm run generate feature
```

This will prompt you for:
- Feature name (singular form)
- Feature description
- Whether to include list view
- Whether to include create form
- Whether to include edit form
- Whether to include delete functionality
- Whether to add to sidebar navigation
- Material-UI icon for navigation

The generator will create:
- MongoDB model
- API routes (collection and individual items)
- Pages (list, create, edit)
- Components (list, form, detail)
- Update sidebar navigation

## Component Generation
- Component templates with Material UI
- Form components with validation
- List components with sorting and filtering
- Detail components for viewing

## API Generation
- Route templates for RESTful APIs
- Controller generation with proper error handling
- Model generation with Mongoose schemas
- Validation generation

## Best Practices
- Template customization
- Naming conventions
- File organization
- Code standards
